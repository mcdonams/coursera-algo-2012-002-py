=========================

My solutions to the programming questions associated with Tim Roughgarden's course "Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part I" on Coursera.

Important note: Coding is done in Python, BUT...  I'm learning Python in-parallel so I make no claims as to correctness with respect to common Python coding standards, etc.  I'm learning all that as I go.
